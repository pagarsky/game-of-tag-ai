# Game of tag AI

## Installation
#### 1\. Install [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) (2019.422f1 tested) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.9.2 tested).  

(Optional) Create and activate python virtual environment:
```shell
$ python3 -m venv ./venv/
```
#### 2\. Install dependencies.
This project heavily(almost completely) depends on Unity [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/release_16_docs) so refer to  [this installation guide](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/release_16_docs/docs/Installation.md) to install ML Agents Unity package. Python packages are also there, but for convenience you can use `requirements.txt`:  
```shell
(venv) $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
#### 3\. Usage (TBD)
